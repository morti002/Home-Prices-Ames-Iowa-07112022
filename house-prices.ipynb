May consider imputing them for features that are deemed significant.\n\n**Create.** Known as 'Feature Engineering', this approach attempts to create new features out of the existing ones which can make better predictions while also reducing noise in the number of features.\n\n**Convert.** Perform the necessary adjustments and transformations to make the datasets normally distributed and fit for modelling.\n\n**Combine.** Known as 'Ensemble Models', this approach aims to combine multiple algorithms into one which leverages the strengths and compensates the weaknesses of the tested models.\n\n**Background of the Problem**\n\nAmes's housing expenses are 5% lower than the national average and the utility prices are 20% lower than the national average. Transportation expenses like bus fares and gas prices are 7% higher than the national average. Ames has grocery prices that are 9% lower than the national average.<sup>1</sup> Ames is an attractive destination for potential homebuyers searching for a low cost of living.
